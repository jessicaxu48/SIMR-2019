# SIMR-2019
Examples of projects for SIMR application - Jessica Xu 

All programs are written in Java 8. 

# Protein Backbone Extraction
Extracts information about the molecules in a protein backbone and writes them to a new file. 

# Protein Backbone Coordinate Extraction 
Extracts the coordinates for the backbone molecules and writes them to a new file. 
The two programs above are run on both the mutated and unmutated (wild) proteins. 

# RMSD Calculations
Applies the root-mean-square deviation formula to each molecule of the mutated and unmutated proteins to calculate the change in protein structure between the mutated and unmutated proteins.
